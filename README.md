# Vehicle Posting Automation Backend

This is a backend application built with **NestJS** that automates the posting of vehicle announcements to a third-party platform using **Puppeteer**. It exposes a single POST endpoint where users can send vehicle data along with a set of images. The backend then handles form submission on the target platform, and returns a screenshot image of the final post.
